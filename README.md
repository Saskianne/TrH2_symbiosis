# TrH2_symbiosis

In this, you can read what I am doing during my research internship. 
The subject of my intership is to find out with which cell type of Trychoplax sp. H2 (TrH2) is associated with the symbionts. For this, the scRNA raw data of TrH2 were acquired from the NCBI. (Details in each code description.)The reference symbiont genome were provided by Harald.
