# Terminal
The best way to access terminal is through the WSL app. This only works when the laptop is connected with the LAN physically. 

# Accessing WS1
ssh -p 22 **user**@134.245.173.59  # to access via ssh
scp -P 22 **user**@134.245.173.59:/path/to/target/remote/file path/to/local/destination/folder
scp -rP 22 **user**@134.245.173.59:/path/to/target/remote/folder path/to/local/destination/folder
